## Data Visualization â€” Topper-Style Notes

- **Aim**: Communicate insights clearly and convincingly.

### Principles
- Clarity, minimalism, truthful scales, readable legends/labels.
- Use preattentive attributes (position, length, color) wisely.

### Chart Selection
- Comparison: bar/line; Distribution: histogram/box; Part-to-whole: stacked; Relationship: scatter.
- Maps for spatial data; networks for relationships.

| Question | Good Charts | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compare categories | Grouped/stacked bar | Show totals or share? |
| Distribution | Hist, KDE, box, violin | Outliers and skew |
| Relationship | Scatter, bubble | Correlation â‰  causation |
| Composition | Stacked bar/area | Avoid 3D pies |
| Time trend | Line, area | Uniform time steps |

### Python: Seaborn quick API
```python
import seaborn as sns, pandas as pd
sns.set_theme(style='whitegrid', context='talk')
# Distributions
sns.displot(df['x'], bins=30)
sns.kdeplot(df['x'])
# Relationships
sns.jointplot(data=df, x='x', y='y', kind='reg')
sns.pairplot(df.select_dtypes('number'))
# Categorical
sns.barplot(data=df, x='cat', y='val', estimator=np.median)
sns.boxplot(data=df, x='cat', y='val')
sns.violinplot(data=df, x='cat', y='val', split=True)
sns.stripplot(data=df, x='cat', y='val', jitter=True, dodge=True)
# Matrix
sns.heatmap(df.corr(numeric_only=True), annot=True, cmap='Blues')
# Grids
g = sns.FacetGrid(df, col='segment', row='region'); g.map_dataframe(sns.scatterplot, x='x', y='y')
```

### RAWGraphs (no-code complex charts)
- **Purpose**: Open-source data visualization tool for complex, non-traditional charts.
- **Why**: Simplifies visualization of complex data for everyone; built on d3.js.
- **Workflow**: Paste data â†’ choose chart â†’ map fields to encodings â†’ customize â†’ export SVG/PNG.
- **Data Import**: Copy-paste from any spreadsheet application.
- **Chart Types**: Alluvial/Sankey diagrams, beeswarm plots, bump charts, circle packing, treemap, streamgraph, sunburst, voronoi diagrams, hexagonal binning.
- **Mapping Process**: 
  - Rating â†’ horizontal axis
  - Production budget â†’ vertical axis  
  - Box office â†’ bubble areas
  - Genre â†’ color coding
  - Movie names â†’ labels
- **Export Options**: Vector (SVG) or raster images for further editing.
- **Advanced Features**: Fine-tuning with graphic editors post-export.
- **Use Cases**: Academic research, journalism, business presentations.
- **Pitfalls**: Limited interactivity; requires external editing for polish.
- **Checklist**: Validate data format; choose appropriate chart type; test readability.

### Pipeline
- Prepare tidy data â†’ choose chart â†’ annotate â†’ test with an audience.

### Video takeaways
- Seaborn: single-line complex plots; grids for faceting; style contexts for presentation.
- RAWGraphs: field-to-encoding mapping workflow; export vector graphics for editing.

### Checks and tips
- Pick palettes by data type (sequential/diverging/qualitative) and ensure colorblind safety.
- Use small multiples over overloaded legends when categories > ~4.
- Control overplotting with alpha/jitter/binning/hex; sample when needed.
- Explain heatmap scaling and clustering choices in captions.

#### Deep dive details

Palette choice:
| Data type | Palette | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sequential (0â†’high) | `viridis`, `magma` | temperatures |
| Diverging (âˆ’â†’+) | `RdBu`, `coolwarm` | z-scores |
| Qualitative (categories) | `tab10`, `Set2` | product lines |

Overplotting tactics:
```python
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='x', y='y', alpha=0.3)
# Binning
sns.histplot(data=df, x='x', y='y', bins=40, pmax=0.95, cbar=True)
# Hexbin
plt.hexbin(df['x'], df['y'], gridsize=40, cmap='viridis')
```

Facet vs stack guidance:
- Facet (small multiples) when categories are many or patterns differ.
- Stack when comparing parts of a whole over time, but watch readability.

Heatmap normalization:
```python
mat = df.pivot_table(index='row', columns='col', values='val', aggfunc='mean')
mat_norm = (mat - mat.min().min()) / (mat.max().max() - mat.min().min())
sns.heatmap(mat_norm, cmap='Blues')
```

### Python plotting
- Purpose: fast EDA and publication-ready charts.
- Why: code-based, reproducible visuals.
- Core: pairplot/jointplot/FacetGrid, heatmaps with correlations/pivots, style/context control.
- Examples:
```python
sns.pairplot(df.select_dtypes('number'))
sns.jointplot(data=df, x='x', y='y', kind='hex')
g = sns.FacetGrid(df, col='segment'); g.map_dataframe(sns.lineplot, x='t', y='y')
```
- Pitfalls: default themes that obscure patterns; misleading color scales.
- Checklist: label axes/units; choose palette by data type; annotate takeaways.

### Web/presentation tools
- Purpose: share interactive or animated visuals quickly.
- Why: low friction for non-coders.
- Core: template selection, data upload, simple transforms, export embeds/PDFs.
- Pitfalls: heavy embeds; inconsistent branding; privacy of uploaded data.
- Checklist: compress assets; consistent styles; verify sharing permissions.

### Office animation
- Purpose: narrate processes and changes over time.
- Why: audiences grasp motion better than static deltas.
- Core: motion paths, timings, emphasis; export to video for distribution.
- Pitfalls: excessive motion; unreadable text during movement.
- Checklist: one movement per beat; large fonts; voiceover or captions.

- Why: easy embedding; broad familiarity.
- Core: connectors, calculated fields, filters; watch quotas.
- Pitfalls: stale caches; quota overruns; slow queries.
- Checklist: pre-aggregate; cache; keep views simple.

### Data Storytelling Fundamentals
- **Purpose**: Make insights memorable and actionable through narrative.
- **Why**: Decisions follow stories; data alone doesn't drive action.
- **Four Storytelling Methods**:
  1. **Numbers**: Raw data with conditional formatting (correlation matrices)
  2. **Visuals**: Charts that tell stories (declining COVID cases over time)
  3. **Text**: Plain language reports explaining performance vs targets
  4. **Illustrations**: Comic-style narratives (Tonga obesity crisis)
- **Integration Approach**: Combine all methods for maximum impact.
- **Core Elements**: Headline + supporting visual, before/after contrasts, annotations.
- **Communication Channels**: Text and illustrations as strong support to numbers/visuals.
- **Future Trend**: Bulk of data communication moving toward integrated storytelling.
- **Applications**: Business reports, academic presentations, journalism, policy communication.
- **Pitfalls**: Burying the lede; chart junk; unclear labels; single-method limitation.
- **Checklist**: One message per visual; annotate key insights; clarify uncertainty; combine methods strategically.

### Actor Network Analysis
- **Purpose**: Analyze social networks and find connection patterns (e.g., shortest path between actors).
- **Why**: Understand collaboration patterns, influence networks, degrees of separation.
- **Data Sources**: IMDb datasets, social media connections, collaboration records.
- **Core Process**:
  - **Data Acquisition**: Download large TSV files (IMDb non-commercial datasets)
  - **Data Filtering**: Focus on specific categories (actors/actresses), set thresholds
  - **Actor Pairing**: Identify significant collaborations (minimum films/co-appearances)
  - **Network Creation**: Build graph from collaboration data
- **Technical Implementation**:
```python
# Libraries: networkx, scikit-network
import networkx as nx
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(actor_pairs)
shortest_path = nx.shortest_path(G, 'Govinda', 'Angelina Jolie')
```
- **Analysis Techniques**:
  - Shortest path algorithms
  - Centrality metrics (betweenness, closeness, degree)
  - Community detection
  - Clustering coefficients
- **Data Challenges**: Name variations, data inconsistencies, large dataset management.
- **Applications**: Six degrees of separation, influence mapping, collaboration analysis.
- **Pitfalls**: Hairball graphs; unlabeled nodes; hiding degree distribution; data quality issues.

import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
sns.scatterplot(data=data, x='x', y='y')
</code></pre>

<!-- Interactive chart integration -->
<section>
  <div id="chart"></div>
  <script>
    Reveal.addEventListener('slidechanged', function(event) {
      if (event.currentSlide.id === 'chart-slide') {
        updateChart(data);
      }
    });
  </script>
</section>
```

- Checklist: test on multiple devices; optimize loading; provide fallbacks.

### Interactive Notebooks (Marimo)
- Purpose: reactive notebooks that update automatically like spreadsheets.
- Why: reproducible, debuggable, interactive web apps.
- Key differences from Jupyter:
  - Cells can't run out of order (enforced dependency graph)
  - Automatic reactivity when cells change
  - Native Python files (version control friendly)
- Core operations:
```python
# Interactive widgets
slider = mo.ui.slider(1, 100)
mo.md(f"Value: {slider.value} {'ðŸŸ¢' * slider.value}")

# Reactive updates
filtered_data = data[data['value'] > slider.value]
mo.ui.table(filtered_data)
```
- Applications: data exploration, interactive reports, web app prototypes.
- Pitfalls: mental shift from Jupyter workflow; learning reactive paradigm.
- Checklist: keep cells atomic; document dependencies; test reactivity.

### Excel Time-Series Visualization

  - Manual bar creation with precise sizing
  - Voiceover synchronization with slide timing
  - Export to video format
- **Flourish Approach**:
  - Template-based race charts (bar, line)
  - Morphing between chart types
  - Scatter plot animations with stagger effects
  - Object constancy for data storytelling
- Examples:
```text
# PowerPoint: Size bars by data values
Shape Format > Width: 6.5" (for $6.5B value)

# Flourish: Animation controls
- Duration: Timeline speed
- Transition: Between-state smoothing
- Stagger: Cascading element animations
```
